# MasterThesisDemo
Code to replicate the results and experiments in the thesis, as well as some demos jupyternotebook. The code is divided into three different folders corresponding to the three different datasets considered.

### PenDigits
The original dataset can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/pen-based+recognition+of+handwritten+digits. The goal of this code was to analyse the performance of the randomized signature as well as to replicate the results of the paper 'Anomaly detection on streamed data' (see https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.03487.pdf and https://github.com/pafoster/conformance_distance_experiments_cochrane_et_al_2020).

### SKAB
The original dataset can be found at https://github.com/waico/SKAB. The goal of this code was to apply the randomized signature for anomaly detection in the field of technical fault detection.

### Speech Commands
The original dataset is presented in the paper 'Speech Commands: A Dataset for Limited-Vocabulary Speech Recognition' (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03209). The goal of the code is to analyse the performance of the ranomized signature for time series classification and to replicate the results of the paper '' (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00873 and https://github.com/jambo6/generalised-signature-method).
