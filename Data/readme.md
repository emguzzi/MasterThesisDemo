# Data
The data for the PenDigits and SKAB experiments is already included in the repository. For the Speech Commands the dataset has larger size. It can either be downloaded as described in the paper ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03209 ) and preprocessed as described in [SpeechCommands](https://github.com/emguzzi/MasterThesisDemo/tree/main/SpeechCommands) or the data already preprocessed can be downloaded from the following [link](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/IAzT2cUSqZpygFr). Two different file can be found there: the one porcessed only with time augmentation 'paths_time.pkl' and the one preprocessed with time and basepoint augmentation 'paths_time_basepoint.pkl'.
