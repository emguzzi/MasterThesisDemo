# SKAB dataset

### SKAB_Signature_Demo
In this notebook one can take a closer look at the SKAB dataset as well as how we apply the randomized signature to tackle the problem. One can try different configuration of hyperparameters and anomaly detection methods.

### grid-search
The following file can be used to experiment the effect of the various hyperparameters on the performance of the model. Also, with this result one can reproduce the Heatmaps in Figure 7 of the thesis.

### utils
Contain functions used in the above files. In particular the function to load the dataset and the function to evaluate a specific model configuration on the dataset.
